system:
  template: "### System: You are an assistant trained to support the bibliographic cataloging and indexing of academic and scientific documents. Your task is to extract structured metadata that supports library cataloging, such as author names, titles, classification codes, and keywords. Only use information explicitly available in the document. If no relevant information is found, return an empty value. Do not generate or assume content. Avoid any explanations or filler text — output must be concise and structured. All answers must be in German, unless explicitly requested otherwise. ### Context: {context} ### User: {question} ### Response:"

# Basic document metadata
document:
  author: "Who is the author or who are the authors of the document {file}? If multiple authors or a team is listed, include all of them. Output the name(s) only, as a comma-separated list — without any introductions, explanations, or phrases like \"The author is\". If no author is mentioned in the document, return an empty string. Your answer must be in German."
  
  title: "What is the title or main heading of the document {file}? Look at the first page only. If no title is found, return an empty string — do not write \"unknown\" or anything else. If a title is found, return only the title — no introductory phrases or explanations. Your answer should be in German."
  
  type: "You are given a document {file}. Determine what type of material it is. Choose exactly one of the following categories (English label): \"Exercise sheet\": a list of tasks or problems, typically used in class or for homework. \"Lecture slides\": visual slides used in lectures or presentations. \"Lecture script\": structured written notes for a lecture, often textbook-like. \"Scientific paper\": academic or peer-reviewed research article. \"Book\": a full-length or chapter of a published book. \"Seminar paper\": a short academic paper submitted for a seminar (e.g., 5–15 pages). \"Bachelor thesis\": final thesis for a bachelor's degree. \"Master thesis\": final thesis for a master's degree. \"Doctoral dissertation\": dissertation written to obtain a doctoral degree. \"Documentation\": user, technical, or project documentation. \"Tutorial\": instructional guide or how-to with practical steps. \"Presentation\": general presentation document, not necessarily lecture-related. \"Poster\": academic or scientific poster used at a conference. \"Protocol\": a record of an experiment, meeting, or session. \"Other\": if no category fits clearly. If you are not sure or cannot determine the type confidently, return an empty string. Otherwise, return only the English category name listed above — no explanation or additional text. The output must be in German."

# Affiliation detection (grouped together)
affiliation:
  basic: "Identify the institutional affiliation of the author in document {file}. Look for the following clues: University or college names (full or abbreviated), Institute names or departments, Email addresses with academic domains (.edu, .ac.*, university domains), Addresses or contact information with university references, Headers or footers with institutional names, Author information with affiliation. Examples of German institutions: Technical Universities: TU Dresden, TU Berlin, TU München, RWTH Aachen; Universities: Universität Hamburg, LMU München, Uni Köln; Universities of Applied Sciences: FH Aachen, Hochschule München, HS Darmstadt; Special Institutes: KIT Karlsruhe, Fraunhofer Institut. Return only the name of the institution, without introductions or explanations. If no institution is found, return an empty string. Answer must be in German."
  
  enhanced: "Search in the document {file} for clues about the author's institutional affiliation. Pay special attention to: University names (full or abbreviated), College or university names (TU, FH, Universität, Hochschule), Institute names or departments, Email addresses with university domains (.edu, .ac.*, university-specific domains), Addresses with university references, Headers or footers with institutional names. Examples of German universities: TU Dresden, TU Berlin, TU München; Universität Hamburg, Uni Köln, LMU München; FH Aachen, Hochschule München; RWTH Aachen, KIT Karlsruhe. Return only the name of the institution. If multiple are found, take the most prominent one. If nothing is found, return an empty string. Answer must be in German."
  
  email_domain: "Search in the document {file} for email addresses and analyze the domains. University domains can be: .edu (international universities), .ac.uk, .ac.at (academic domains), tu-dresden.de, uni-hamburg.de, etc., fh-aachen.de, hs-münchen.de, etc. If you find an email address with a university domain, derive the university name from it. Examples: max.mustermann@tu-dresden.de → TU Dresden; anna.beispiel@uni-hamburg.de → Universität Hamburg; test@fh-aachen.de → FH Aachen. Return only the derived university name or an empty string. Answer must be in German."

# Keywords extraction (grouped by type)
keywords:
  extract: "Extract at least 10 precise German keywords from the document {file}. The keywords should be suitable for library cataloging. Focus on specific and content-relevant terms — avoid generic words or phrases. Return a comma-separated list of keywords in German, with no introduction or explanation. Output only the list, in German."
  
  generate: "Generate at least 10 precise German keywords describing the content of the document {file}. The keywords should be suitable for library cataloging. Focus on specific and content-relevant terms — avoid generic words or phrases. Return a comma-separated list of keywords in German, with no introduction or explanation. Output only the list, in German."
  
  controlled_vocabulary: "Assign 15 keywords from relevant controlled vocabularies or subject headings to the document {file}. If no specific controlled vocabulary keywords are available for certain concepts, use broader terms where possible, even if they are more general. Combine keywords into chains to specify specialized concepts more accurately, especially when only general terms are available. Return only a comma-separated list of the keywords — no introduction or explanation. The answer must be in German."

# Document summarization
summary:
  generate: "Create a concise summary of the document {file} in exactly 3 sentences. The summary should capture the main content, purpose, and key information of the educational material. Focus on what learners would gain from this document. Do not include introductory phrases like 'This document' or 'The summary is'. Return only the 3-sentence summary in German, with clear and informative content."
  
  structured: "Summarize the document {file} by addressing these three aspects in 3 sentences: 1) What is the main topic or subject area? 2) What type of educational content is provided (exercises, theory, examples, etc.)? 3) Who is the target audience or what learning objectives are addressed? Return only the structured 3-sentence summary in German, without introductory phrases."

# Classification system (Dewey Decimal Classification)
classification:
  dewey_direct: "Assign the document {file} to up to three suitable Dewey Decimal Classifications (DDC), ranked by relevance. Return the result as a JSON array, where each entry includes: \"notation\": the DDC classification number (as a string), \"label\": the classification label in German, \"score\": a floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0 representing relevance. If no valid classification can be determined, return an empty JSON array ([]). Use only officially recognized Dewey Decimal Classification notations. Respond with a valid raw JSON string only, without any markdown formatting (no ```json ...), explanations, or commentary."
  
  # Two-step Dewey classification
  thematic_analysis: "Analyze the content of the document {file} and describe the main themes. Which academic fields are covered? Name 3-5 main themes or academic fields as keywords (e.g., \"Informatik\", \"Mathematik\", \"Pädagogik\", \"Geschichte\", etc.). Respond only with the thematic areas, separated by commas. Answer must be in German."
  
  dewey_mapping: "Based on the identified thematic areas: \"{thematic_areas}\" Map these themes to appropriate Dewey Decimal Classifications. Use ONLY the following official Dewey classifications: {dewey_sample} Select a maximum of 3 suitable classifications from the above list. Respond ONLY with a valid JSON array in the format: [{{\"notation\": \"XXX\", \"label\": \"Beschreibung\", \"score\": 0.X}}] No explanations or additional text. Answer must be in German."
